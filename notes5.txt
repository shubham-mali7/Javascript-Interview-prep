Understanding the JavaScript Function:

javascript
Copy code
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
Base Case:

The function checks if n is either 0 or 1. If it is, it returns 1. This is like saying the factorial of 0 or 1 is 1.
Recursive Case:

If n is greater than 1, the function does the following:
It multiplies n by the result of calling itself with the argument n - 1.
This means, for example, factorial(5) is calculated as 5 * factorial(4).
The process continues until it reaches the base case (n === 0 or n === 1), at which point the function starts returning values.
Example Usage:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
console.log(factorial(3)); // Output: 6
factorial(5) is essentially 
5

4

1
5×4×3×2×1, which equals 120.
factorial(3) is 
3

1
3×2×1, which equals 6.
Visualization:

The second occurrence of factorial inside the function is what we call a "recursive call." Let me break down its purpose and why it's essential in the context of calculating factorials.

Here's the relevant part of the code:

javascript
Copy code
return n * factorial(n - 1);
Recursive Call:

factorial(n - 1) is calling the same function (the one we're currently defining) but with a smaller argument (n - 1).
Purpose:

This recursive call is crucial because it helps break down the original problem (calculating factorial(n)) into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
Each recursive call is working towards the base case (n === 0 or n === 1), where we know the result is 1.
Example to Understand:

Let's take the example of factorial(5) to understand the flow.
factorial(5) wants to find the factorial of 5, which is 
5
×
4
×
3
×
2
×
1
5×4×3×2×1.
It breaks it down into 5 * factorial(4).
factorial(4) is then 
4
×
3
×
2
×
1
4×3×2×1.
This continues until we reach factorial(1), which is 1 according to our base case.
Termination at Base Case:

The base case (n === 0 or n === 1) is vital to stop the recursion. Once n reaches 0 or 1, the function stops breaking the problem into smaller parts and starts returning values.
Overall Role:

The recursive calls handle the repetitive nature of the factorial calculation by solving smaller versions of the same problem until reaching the base case.
In summary, the recursive call is a way to express the fact that calculating the factorial of a number involves multiplying that number by the factorial of a smaller number. The recursion allows the function to elegantly handle this repetitive multiplication until it reaches a known base case.
